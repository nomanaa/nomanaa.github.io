# How to Replicate Adversary Behavior

Replicating adversary behavior means simulating the activities an attacker would carry out to achieve their goals.  
By copying the steps of a real-world attacker, defenders can study how systems respond and learn how to detect or prevent those actions.  
The MITRE ATT&CK framework is the guide for this process.

# The ATT&CK Framework

The **ATT&CK framework** is a descriptive model used to label and study the activities that a threat actor is capable of carrying out.  
It applies to enterprise environments, cloud environments, and even industrial control systems.  

Key features:
- Provides a **common taxonomy** for the cybersecurity community to describe adversary behavior.  
- Works as a **common language** for defenders and attackers.  
- Contains **14 main tactics** that represent different stages of an attack.

## The 14 Tactics

1. **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the victim.  
2. **Resource Development:** Assessing or creating resources to support the operation. *(Reconnaissance and Resource Development fall into the pre-breach stage.)*  
3. **Initial Access:** The first foothold in the victim’s environment.  
4. **Execution:** Running malicious code inside the environment.  
5. **Persistence:** Remaining in the system even after reboot or shutdown.  
6. **Privilege Escalation:** Elevating access after entering with a low-privilege account.  
7. **Defense Evasion:** Avoiding detection by altering or removing traces.  
8. **Credential Access:** Stealing legitimate credentials.  
9. **Discovery:** Learning about the victim’s environment and setup.  
10. **Lateral Movement:** Pivoting from one system to another.  
11. **Collection:** Gathering information for later exfiltration.  
12. **Command and Control:** Communicating with systems under the attacker’s control.  
13. **Exfiltration:** Stealing data while remaining undetected.  
14. **Impact:** Preventing the victim from accessing systems.  

Each tactic includes many **techniques**, which are further broken into **sub-techniques**.  
The most specific level is the **procedure**—the exact command or method an adversary uses.  

Example: An adversary saving network configuration values to a text file is performing a **Discovery tactic**, using the **Command and Scripting Interpreter technique**, and the **PowerShell sub-technique**.

# The ATT&CK Matrix

The **ATT&CK Matrix** is the main way the framework is visualized:  
- **Columns = Tactics**  
- **Techniques = Listed under each tactic**  
- **Sub-techniques = Expandable under techniques**  

Each technique page includes:
- The technique’s name and description.  
- A list of sub-techniques.  
- Platforms it applies to.  
- Data sources for finding related activity.  
- Mitigation techniques to counter the behavior.  

This consistent structure makes ATT&CK an excellent tool for planning **blue team** and **red team** exercises.

# Mapping with ATT&CK

Mapping means linking observed activity back to the ATT&CK framework.  
It allows defenders to answer questions such as:
- Which tactic does this activity belong to?  
- Which technique or sub-technique was used?  
- What procedures did the adversary carry out?  

By mapping logs or alerts to ATT&CK, organizations can identify gaps in their defenses and improve their detection strategies.

# The ATT&CK Navigator

The **ATT&CK Navigator** is an interactive way to work with the matrix.  
It allows users to highlight, score, and layer techniques for analysis.

# Conclusion

The **MITRE ATT&CK framework** gives defenders and researchers a structured way to understand adversary behavior.  
By learning the 14 tactics, studying techniques, and mapping activity back to ATT&CK, teams can replicate adversary actions in a safe environment and strengthen their defenses.  
The ATT&CK Navigator makes this process interactive and easier to apply for both blue and red team exercises.
