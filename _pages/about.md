Hi, I’m **Abdul** — a cybersecurity professional driven by curiosity, persistence, and a passion for solving complex problems. What started as an interest in how systems break quickly grew into a career focused on **how to secure them**.  

I’m currently working in **Cybersecurity Consulting**, where I design secure architectures, detect threats, and respond to incidents. In addition to that, I work with clients on behalf of my employer to advise them about **vulnerabilities** found in their systems and how to mitigate them. Every day brings new challenges: whether it’s analyzing logs to uncover hidden patterns, automating security workflows, or aligning defenses with frameworks like **NIST** and **ISO 27001**. That constant evolution is exactly what excites me — in security, standing still isn’t an option.  

This portfolio reflects my **thoughts** and serves as a **living space for ideas and exploration**. Here, you’ll find:  

- **Projects** that showcase the tools and systems I’m working with and cybersecurity concepts that I test.  
- **Blog posts** that dive into lessons learned, practical tutorials, and reflections on topics related to cybersecurity.    

My goal is to make this a place where others — whether security professionals, students, or simply the curious — can learn something new, spark a conversation, or even challenge my perspective. If you’re curious about how technology can be made safer, or if you just love the thrill of chasing answers to hard problems, you’re in the right place. Let’s explore it together.
